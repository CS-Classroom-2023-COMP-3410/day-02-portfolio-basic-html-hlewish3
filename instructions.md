2. **Web Pages**: Create at least three HTML pages, where one page is in a file named `index.html`.
    - Home Page
        - Include whatever you want here, be creative! Some ideas include your name, art that you have made, links to websites that you like, collections of information that you care about (quotes, books, sports stats, video games...?).
    - About Me
        - Include a description, a photo, a list of skills/hobbies, and anything else you want.
