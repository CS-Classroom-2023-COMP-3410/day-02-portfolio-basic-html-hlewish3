I'll say, writing ANYTHING remotely pleasing using pure HTML makes me appreciate all the tools that we have at our disposal today.

One major hurdle that I faced was centering a block of non-wrapping text in the center of the screen without changing the alignment of the text itself.
I think this might be possible using pure HTML, but I couldn't figure it out.

One strategy I tried was placing it in a table (with width 50%), then placing a single center-aligned cell inside it. 
Within that cell, I placed a div that had left alignment (containing the text).
This looks great, but doesn't stay coherent at low zoom levels.
